OOP Inventory System in Python

An Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) inventory system in Python utilizes classes to model real-world inventory items and their attributes (name, quantity, price, etc.). By encapsulating data and behavior within objects, it promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. Key features include:

Item class: Represents individual inventory items with properties and methods for managing item details.
Inventory class: Manages a collection of items, providing functionalities for adding, removing, searching, and updating items.
Data persistence: Stores inventory data efficiently using files, databases, or other storage mechanisms.
User interface: Interacts with users to perform inventory operations (adding, removing, searching, etc.) through a command-line interface or graphical user interface.
